# Question

Consider the React component below. Explain the three ways that we can provide a dependency array to trigger the `useEffect` callback to run. For each, provide an example of the dependency array to help explain your answer.

```js
const MyComponent = ({ someProp }) => {
  const [someState, setSomeState] = useState('');

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('hello world');
  }, '???');

  return (
    <div>
      <!-- Some More JSX -->
    </div>
  );
}
```

# Answer

we can leave no dependency array and it will re-render every time the component renders. If we leave an empty array like `[]`, it will run every time the component is mounted. If we have an array like this `[wrld]`, every time `wrld` changes the function will run and re-render whatever component.
